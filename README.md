This is an ongoing work. See this repo, until new advice, as a collection of notes. Thanks!

## Notes

As I did years ago with `React` (tutorial that I should resume someday; please, forgive my laziness), I decided to put (and publish) some notes related to the new kid on the block, the JS Superset `TypeScript`.

Later, we will use `typescript` locally (feel free to install it as a global package: `npm install -g typescript`). But, for the moment, we consume [repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/typescript)
